# SmackAthon

The goal of this project is to create an interface where the user can see the top movies, find title of the movie, director, short synopsis, and show them tweets about the movie in a modal when they click on the movie. Additional features may include but are not limited to: adding a funny voice to read the tweets out loud, restricting the tweets to be from accounts with a minimum amount of followers, and showing the longer plot from omdb.
